## How to use
1.  **Visit the Website**: [https://sidshot.github.io/upsc-study-desk/](https://sidshot.github.io/upsc-study-desk/) (Bookmark this!)
2.  Click **"Select Master Folder"**.
3.  Choose the folder where you keep your study materials (e.g., `D:\UPSC Material`).
    > **CRITICAL**: Your folder structure MUST match this hierarchy:
    > `Paper` -> `Provider` -> `Course` -> `Files`
    > *Example*: `GS1` -> `Vision IAS` -> `History` -> `Lecture 1.mp4`

4.  Allow browser permissions when prompted.

## Hosting on GitHub (for yourself or friends)
1.  Upload (push) these files to a GitHub repository.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and click **Save**.
4.  Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name/`.

**Note**: Hosting the site online does NOT upload your study files. It only hosts the *interface*. Use the "Select Master Folder" button to connect the online interface to your local files.
